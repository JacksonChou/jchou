I am a data science and analytics professional currently working in the HR/People domain. My passion lies in enabling decision-makers with analytics products that are simple and easy to use. Currently I lead the People Analytics team at New Relic where I focus on democratizing people data and develop analytics best practices and data literacy within the People team.

In my downtime, I enjoy city walks and hikes with my family and our Australian cattle dog, Red (he's 16!). I also geek out on sports analytics (fantasy basketball and football) and have an immense backlog of PC games.
