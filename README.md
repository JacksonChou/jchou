Hello! This is the repo of my [personal website](https://jacksonchou.com). The site was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [deployed](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html) on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Acknowledgements and Resources

I highly recommend checking out Quarto's [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) on building a website, it's a great place to get started. Once you're all setup, there's a ton of options for publishing listed [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) with easy instructions.

I also learned a ton from Jadey Ryan's [A beginnerâ€™s guide to building a simple website with Quarto & Netlify](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2024-02-19_beginner-quarto-netlify//) and Cynthia Huang's guide on [Publishing HTML and PDF versions of a Quarto CV without LaTex](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/).
